# banking-chatbot-using-NLP

# Introduction
With the rapid growth of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), chatbots have become widely used in many fields, especially in banking. In todayâ€™s digital age, customers want fast, efficient, and personalized support available 24/7. 
Traditional ways of customer service, like phone support or visiting a bank in person, often fall short because of long waiting times and limited hours.
A chatbot is a type of software designed to have a conversation with a user in everyday language, similar to talking to a human. 
These chatbots use artificial intelligence (AI) to understand questions, provide accurate answers, and share relevant information from their knowledge base.

# Problem definition
    This project aims to improve slow and expensive customer service in banks by creating a smart chatbot using Natural Language Processing(NLP). Traditional customer service methods often have long wait times and can be confusing. The chatbot will provide quick, clear answers to questions about account types, loans and bank policies, making it easier for customer to get help anytime. This will also reduce the bank workload and costs.

# Technologies Used
The system utilizes **NLTK** for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and punctuation removal, ensuring structured and clean input for processing. **SpeechRecognition** converts voice input into text, allowing seamless voice-based interaction. **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** (from Scikit-learn) are used for response generation by finding the most relevant sentence from the corpus. **GoogleTrans** enables language translation, making the chatbot accessible in multiple languages. **Pyttsx3** provides text-to-speech (TTS) functionality, allowing responses to be read aloud in voice mode. The system follows a structured session flow and implements robust **error handling** to manage speech recognition failures and unrecognized queries effectively.
